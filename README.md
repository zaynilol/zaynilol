Getting Started

Click the button below to connect your Spotify account with the Vercel app. This is needed to access your recently played tracks.

    By authorizing the app, you agree to have your Spotify username, access token, and refresh token stored on a secure Firebase database. This is required so you only need to authorize once and the app can automatically refresh access tokens in order to retrieve recent tracks.

    You can revoke the app at https://www.spotify.com/account/apps.

After granting permission, just add the following into your README and set the user query parameter to your Spotify username.

GHPV–° project is proof of concept. This counter designed to be an analytical instrument for you, but not for people who are visiting your profile It could be used to see profile views dynamics as result of development activity, blogging or taking part in a conference.

It counts how many times your GitHub profile has been viewed and displays them in your profile, for free.

Usage

Cloud solution launched as 100% free experience. Help me cut server costs if you like this service.

If you want to see big numbers in your profile, deploy a standalone solution to draw any views count you want without spamming our server. Everybody knows that any counters could be faked.
